# Parking-permit-BPMN
Project report for Business Process Modeling
## Case
Let us consider the scenario of a citizen who wants to renew his parking permit for her/his residence zone. The citizen contacts the municipal office to ask information and gets a list of forms to be filled and of documents to prepare. Once the citizen has delivered all documents and forms, an office worker checks them carefully and takes one of the following decisions: to release the permit, to revoke the permit, to ask for missing information (e.g., further documents) or to ask for the revision of some forms (e.g., because they were not properly filled). The delivery of documents and their analysis can take place for any number of times, until the parking permit is released to the citizen or it is revoked.
Design and analyze suitable processes that model the above scenario.
Modify the process of the office worker in such a way that (s)he continues to ask for forms revision at each iteration and analyze the overall system.
